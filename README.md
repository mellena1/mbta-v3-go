[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mellena1/mbta-v3-go/mbta?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mellena1/mbta-v3-go/mbta)

A Go client for the [MBTA v3 REST API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api).

## Disclaimer
This project is considered done by us, but hasn't been fully tested in a production environment. Feel free to use it and if you encounter bugs, raise an issue and we will try to fix them.

## Package Layout
This project was designed based on the [go-github library](https://github.com/google/go-github). Therefore, we have one main package folder called `mbta`, and all files in that correspond to different API calls.
